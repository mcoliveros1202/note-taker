  ## Description
    This project allows the user to create and save notes with a title and a note body.

  ## Installation
    There is no installation process.

  ## Usage
    To use this application, simply start the server, got to the deployed application via Heroku, and click the "Get Started" button. The user is able to instantly begin creating and saving notes. Once notes are created, the user is able to open previous notes to reference what was written in them. In the future, the ability to delete unwanted notes will be added.
